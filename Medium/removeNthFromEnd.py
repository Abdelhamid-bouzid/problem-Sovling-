'''
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
