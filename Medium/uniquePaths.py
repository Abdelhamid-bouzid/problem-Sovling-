'''
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
Example 3:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
Example 4:

Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6

        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            dp[0][j] = 1
        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
